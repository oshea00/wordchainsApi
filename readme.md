# Word Chains API

## Serverless framework example with C#
Example of using .Net Core 3.1 as the AWS lambda runtime with a fun puzzle.

## Example Chains
* [trout truth](https://qux5svesmk.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/wordchain?from=trout&to=truth)
* [game over](https://qux5svesmk.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/wordchain?from=game&to=over)
* [cat dog](https://qux5svesmk.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/wordchain?from=cat&to=dog)

Not all words have paths to each other - in fact quite a few pairs are fruitless. Shorter words are better.
